## Usage Guide

### Chat Assistant
1. Navigate to the "Chat Assistant" tab
2. Type logistics-related questions in the chat input
3. Use suggested questions for quick examples
4. View conversation history in the chat interface

### Demand Forecasting
1. Go to the "Demand Forecasting" tab
2. Select forecast period (7-90 days)
3. Choose a specific route or "All Routes"
4. Click "Generate Forecast" to create predictions
5. View interactive charts with confidence intervals
6. Analyze forecast metrics and insights

### Analytics Dashboard
1. Access the "Analytics Dashboard" tab
2. Review key performance indicators at the top
3. Explore various visualizations:
   - Daily demand trends
   - Route performance
   - Container type distribution
   - Risk assessment
   - Seasonal patterns
4. Use the data table for detailed shipment information

## Data

The application uses generated sample data that simulates realistic logistics scenarios with:
- 2 years of historical shipping data
- Multiple trade routes (Asia-Europe, Trans-Pacific, etc.)
- Various container types and port locations
- Risk assessments and cost information
- Seasonal demand patterns

For production use, replace the sample data generation with your actual logistics data.

## Features in Detail

### AI Chat Integration

- Context-aware conversations about logistics topics
- Error handling and fallback responses
- Chat history preservation during session

### Prophet Forecasting
- Handles seasonality (daily, weekly, yearly)
- Automatic trend detection
- Confidence intervals for predictions
- Customizable forecasting periods

### Interactive Visualizations
- Responsive Plotly charts
- Multiple chart types (line, bar, pie, heatmap)
- Real-time data updates
- Export capabilities

## Customization

### Adding New Features
- Extend the `LogisticsAssistant` class
- Add new tabs in the `run()` method
- Create additional visualization functions
- Integrate with other APIs or data sources

### Modifying Forecasting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Prophet Installation**: If Prophet fails to install, try:
   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge prophet
   ```

2. **API Key Issues**: Ensure your Perplexity API key is correctly set in secrets

3. **Memory Issues**: For large datasets, consider data sampling or pagination

4. **Deployment Errors**: Check Streamlit Cloud logs and ensure all dependencies are in requirements.txt

### Performance Optimization
- Use `@st.cache_data` for expensive computations
- Implement data pagination for large datasets
- Optimize Prophet model parameters
- Use efficient data structures
